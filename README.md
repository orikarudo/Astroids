# Astroids
Project 3 for CS441 

This project is a simple game where a clown head floats around outerspace and the player has the option to toggle gravity and increase speed. The game loads to a first "welcome" view controller and starts after the player clicks "go"

Day 1: Initial commit, created basic files and minor tweaks
Day 2: work done on start page, added buttons etc.
Day 3: fixed some layout issues
Day 4: added view controller and started work for the bouncing head scene
Day 5: configured sprite files to work with vc. added buttons and head sprites
Day 6: Bug fixes and started physics
Day 7: got the object to bounce around and at desired speed
Day 8: got the gravity and speed buttons to be functional and made the final touches


P.S. I renamed this file a couple of times so you might see files with the old name like "astroids" or "floating heads"
P.S.S I messed up the gamescene files in my original program, but didn't want to start over so I copied them over from a new blank project called "BouncyBall". For some reason the two files "BouncyBall" and "Bouncing-head" need to be in the same directory
